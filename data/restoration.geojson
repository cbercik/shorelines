    "Description":"In the year 2000 several populations of invasive marine algae, Caulerpa taxifolia, were found in Southern California, specifically in Huntington Beach and in Carlsbad. In Europe and Australia, releases of this species resulted in extensive populations of the seaweed destroying native communities and reducing biodiversity in both native aquatic vegetation and animal communities relying on the vegetation.  \n                This project led to the successful removal of the invasive seaweed species, protecting native biodiversity and functioning ecosystems. Surveys conducted verified that the removal of the species was complete. Reducing purple urchin density in the benthic environment allows kelp forests to regrow and support fish and invertebrate communities. Currently, 46 acres of kelp forest have been restored using this method. The project has observed increasing biodiversity and biomass in kelp, invertebrate, and fish populations, as well as increases in the availability of recreational fishing targets and increased red urchin yield to fisheries.

    "Description":"Mission Bay, located in San Diego, California, was once a tidal mudflat that served as an alternating endpoint of the San Diego River along with San Diego Bay. In the early 19th century, San Diego’s importance as a naval and shipping port grew, and the Army Corps of Engineers dredged out what is now Mission Bay in order to save the larger San Diego Bay from sedimentation. Mission Bay has been a recreational area since its creation, and has routine dredging to maintain the bay.\n                This project attempts to mitigate negative impacts from the routine dredging by replanting eelgrass in areas where dredging has damaged the bay ecosystem. This project includes both mapping of the extent of seagrass within Mission Bay as well as the replanting of the seagrass.  ",

    "Description":"For the last 100 years, kelp forests off the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, California have been shrinking. Urban runoff, development, and sedimentation limits kelp growth, while overfishing reduces competition and predation of purple urchins. Purple urchins consume the kelp holdfasts at the ocean floor and create urchin barrens, destroying kelp forest and related communities that live in the kelp forests.\n                This restoration project aims to reduce purple urchin density in the benthic environment, allowing kelp forests to regrow and support fish and invertebrate communities. Currently, 46 acres of kelp forest have been restored using this method.

All areas experienced successful growth, with restored seagrass populations spreading to previously barren areas. Animals, including both fishery and other food web species, were observed to be rapidly recolonizing the restored beds. The project estimates that about $9 million in value was restored by recovering previously unproductive bay area.",

Apart from water quality upgrades, the project also directly planted seagrass using both hand and mechanical methods. Both of these programs failed without the water quality being in optimal levels.

This is because of sediment quality issues related to organic nutrient loading.

Despite early indicators of success, by the summer of 2005 almost all plants were gone, due to limited light availability and higher water temperatures than the seagrass needed.",
