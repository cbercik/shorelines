					<h2>Seagrass</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
					<p>
						Seagrasses are underwater plants that resemble their terrestrial counterparts but differ in that they reside underwater and do not have stems to support themselves, relying on their natural buoyancy in water to keep them
						upright instead. Excluding polar regions, seagrasses can be found all over the world, but their distribution is limited to coastal waters as they are restricted by depth due to the plant’s heavy reliance on sunlight. Despite
						this, seagrasses are unrivaled in terms of productivity, creating some of the most unique and important ecosystems around the world.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 ml-auto">
					<p>
						Seagrasses are known as “ecosystem engineers” due to their impact on shaping and modifying their local habitats. A major service that seagrasses provide to their environment is blue carbon sequestration. Much in the same way
						trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and limit the damage caused by the greenhouse effect, the blue carbon sequestration performed by seagrasses removes carbon dioxide from their local environments and mitigates the
						effects of ocean acidification. As such, seagrasses play a critical role in maintaining the health of local marine ecosystems. Additionally, because this blue carbon sequestration is attributed to photosynthetic processes
						performed by seagrass, another major service that seagrass provides is food and shelter for local animals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
					<p>
						The blue carbon sequestered from coastal and marine ecosystems into seagrasses effectively converts dissolved carbon dioxide into floral biomass. This biomass provides the necessary organic compound required for primary
						production, making seagrasses a food source for animals such as sea turtles, herbivorous marine mammals such as manatees and dugongs, and migratory birds. Additionally, seagrass meadows serve as shelter for smaller marine
						animals such as shrimp, crabs, and fish larvae. As such, countless species rely on seagrasses, and many would find their survival in jeopardy if seagrasses were removed.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
					<p>
						With substantial alterations both in its biological and chemical profiles, seagrasses are vulnerable to mass destruction and eradication. Although seagrasses are effective at combating climate change through blue carbon
						sequestration, its demise is also due to climate change. While the causes for this range from storms to overgrazing and drought, the most notable threat to seagrass is eutrophication. Eutrophication is the excessive growth of
						algae caused in bodies of water due to an influx of nutrients, which deoxygenates the local environment, effectively suffocating the local wildlife, and blocks sunlight to photosynthetic plants. As such, the loss of this
						keystone species will damage all aspects of the local ecosystem and many of the organisms that rely on the services provided by seagrasses will become threatened. Additionally, the elimination of seagrasses would have a
						significant economic impact, valued at a loss of US $19,002 per hectare per year. As such, the protection and restoration of seagrasses are vital to the health and survival of marine environments due to its far-reaching
						effects on the various communities connected to their presence.

					<h2>Kelp Forests</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
					<p>
						Kelp are giant brown algae that live in shallow waters close to shore and thrive in cold, nutrient-rich, clear waters. They typically live further from the warmer-water of seagrass beds and do not overlap with other marine vegetation systems. Unlike seagrasses, kelp is not actually a plant. Although they photosynthesize much alike their plant counterparts, they lack roots, stems, and leaves, dreaming them part of the algae family. Kelp attaches to the seafloor and eventually grows to reach the water's surface. Because of this, they generate their food and energy from sunlight.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
					<p>
						Much like forests on land, kelp forests provide homes for fish, invertebrates, and marine mammals. The forests are made up of many different species of kelp and are a very dynamic system. Their appearance is dependent on the population sizes of the primary herbivores and oceanographic conditions. Some marine species use the forests to spawn offspring and as a juvenile nursery habitat. Since kelp grow up to 18 inches per day, their ability to provide a dense canopy on the sea surface has led to an intimate relationship with many marine species. The warmer water and slow currents of the ocean’s surface provides shelter from predators and storms.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
					<p>
						A large benefit of kelp in our oceans is greenhouse gas regulation. They take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, sowing the rate of ocean acidification. Without kelp to help regulate the ocean carbonic system, the ocean’s would be warming and acidifying at a rate too large for ecosystems to handle.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
					<p>
						Not only is kelp beneficial to marine organisms and the climate system, but many beauty products and supplements are made from kelp due to its rich nutritional value. Kelp contains anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Kelp has been found in products such as face masks, skin cream, and even toothpaste.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
					<p>
						Despite its helpful properties, kelp are at a severe threat to global warming. When longer, hotter summers and shorter winters arise, fewer nutrients are available to kelp which threatens their survival. Various human activities also pose threats for these forests as coastal development, sedimentation, over-shishing, commercial harvesting and pollution threaten the lives of kelp forests. More high energy storms due to climate change can uproot plants and destroy entire habitats. El Nino Southern Oscillation Events contributed to high ocean temperatures and strong wave energy which led to the demise of many kelp forests in California. In terms of pollution, sewage, industrial disposal, and coastal runoff all contribute to high sedimentation and kelp forest degradation. Reduced growth rates and less reproductive success of kelp forests have been linked to toxic waters and high waste discharges in many studies. It is imperative to keep kelp forests thriving in our oceans. They provide numerous benefits to many different ecosystems and are a crucial element in the survival of many of the ocean’s marine organisms. Because of this, restoration of kelp forests is long-underway and existing forests are being closely monitored by some of the nation’s elite research institutes on oceanic sciences.
