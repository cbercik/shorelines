                                            With ocean acidification on the rise, the 2016-2017 practicum team members, Rebecca Ash, Candace Chang, Kathleen Lo, Ariel Pezner, Jeric Rosas, and Kelli Wright set out to determine how kelp forests could affect ocean acidification.

                                            Kelp is known to alter the chemical composition of the water around them. However, at the time, the extent of kelp’s ability to combat ocean acidification had not yet been fully explored. Due to a massive
                                            decrease in canopy size, The Bay Foundation was spearheading a restoration project off the coast of Palos Verdes. This restoration area was analyzed by the practicum team in an effort to determine the
                                            efficacy of this, and similar sites, as refuges from rising acidification.

                                            Using sampling tools, flow-through sensors, and drones, the team took a holistic approach to understanding the nuances of the kelp forest habitat. They measured multiple aspects of water chemistry

                                            Additionally, using a combination of flow-through sensors and other sampling techniques, the team measured the abundance of phytoplankton in an effort to characterize the limitations of their results.

                                            In order to show the importance of such habitats, they also conducted an in-depth literature review of commercially and culturally important species that live within kelp forests; specifically focusing on
                                            how they may react to rising acidification. Lastly, the team attempted to understand the spatial scale of any results they collected by using a combination of dissolved CO2 readings from a flow through
                                            sensor and drone aerial footage.

                                                    Kelp forests show promise when it comes to acting as refuges to ocean acidification

                                                    Kelp restorations sites can have significant spatial, chemical, and temporal alterations of the water around them

                                                <li>
                                                    This kelp site seemed to show an increase in pH (decrease in ocean acidification) as the restored site began to grow and expand

                                            If true, this has major implications on the efficacy and importance of restoration practices regarding kelp forests in California. On the other hand, it is important to note that the above findings were seen even when they measured phytoplankton abundance (determining that their findings were not largely influenced by their photosynthesis rates). They acknowledged that there may have been upwelling during their sampling periods which should have lowered the pH even further.

                                            In an effort to build upon the 2016-2017 results, the research team of Anna George, Noah Horvath, Destiny Johnson, Eileen Ly, Roajhaan Sakaki, and Shang Shi set out to better understand how marine vegetation can affect ocean acidification. By broadening their scope to include both giant kelp and eelgrass, the team developed a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between local marine habitats and water chemistry.

                                            With the continued increase of anthropogenic carbon emissions, this research could be imperative to better understand what future oceans will look like. As seawater absorbs these carbon emissions, oceanic acidity increases and threatens shellfish and the chemical equilibrium. If the team were to find that seagrass meadows and kelp forests can help mitigate the deleterious effects of anthropogenic ocean acidification, the students would build upon the scientific support for conservation and restoration of these protective heavens.

                                            To start, the team analyzed satellite photos and sonar data to pick three separate sites:

                                            Solstice Canyon, Malibu was determined to have all three of the above sites isolated from one another, lending itself to be the prime location to conduct their research. Using multiple flow-through sensors attached to UCLA’s research vessel <i>Zodiac</i>, the team began to measure the surface levels of:

                                            However, due to the tricky nature of flow-through sensors, the Dissolved CO2 sensor was found to be jammed which may have lended to certain limitations in their results.

                                            In addition, the team used a SmarTROLL sensor, a cylinder that can be lowered to different depths to measure a host of chemical characteristics of the water column at different depths. The

                                            This sampling method - in contrast to the flow-through sensors - allowed the team to get depth profiles, completing a more holistic understanding of the chemical changes kelp and or seagrass may have upon the water column. Once the team collected their data over a period of 3 field days spanning roughly a month, they used Excel, MatLab, and Esri ArcGIS to analyze and visualize the data.

                                            The team was able to determine that there were, in fact, differences in all three sites. They found that while the control regions had fairly stable, more acidic ranges of pH, seagrass and kelp sites had wider ranges of pH that did trend towards more basic pH. This does prove that kelp and seagrass have some influence on the surrounding water column, however, it only implies that these habitats can reduce the amount of acidification.

                                            As ocean acidification intensifies along the California coast the need for mitigation strategies is becoming more and more important. In an effort to determine how seagrass meadows could act as buffers or refuges for marine organisms, Ryan Distaso, Emma Burckert, Mackenzie Jackson, Eyal Li, Gonzalo Gutierrez, Evan Gentry, and Britanie Iraheta collected data to show to what extent this may be true.

Moreover, they wanted to look into how the density of the meadow may affect the species ability to change the chemistry of the water column around them.

                                            Additionally, the team took a new approach to determining the health and density of the seagrass meadows at the sampling sites. In order to do so, they mounted the pH probe as well as a GoPro camera onto a constructed PVC cage that could be lowered to the sea floor. They then inferred the density of the seagrass meadows using the bottom of the cage as a transect, thus, finding the % cover within that transect.

                                            What the team found was contradictory to both previous scientific data as well as their own hypothesis. They found little to no difference in the pH and dissolved oxygen levels of both high and low density sites. This discrepancy could be attributed to multiple limitations within this study, namely, a lack of high density sites and the presence of other organisms such as kelp and phytoplankton in the area. The team mentioned that in such environments, it is hard to distinguish between effects from the surrounding environment and effects caused by the seagrass in question. Future projects should focus on eliminating confounding variables in order to determine the true effects of seagrass upon the chemical composition of the water column.

Using ArcGIS and side scan software they determined that this is an effective and cost efficient method in determining the extent of meadows. However, it should be known that they did so by manually classifying/ground truthing the remote sensing data. More research will need to be done, as unsupervised/automatic classification did not produce quality results.

                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                Natural recovery from a natural or anthropogenic change
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Anthropogenic interventions in response to a degraded environment
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Anthropogenic responses to a single stressor
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Habitat enhancement or creation
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>
                                        Furthermore, they determine best practices which show that restoration projects rarely (if ever) produce habitats that function at levels that they naturally would have. In this case it then becomes most efficient to find the stressor causing degradation and simply remove it. Additionally, they place a huge emphasis on the need for further scientific knowledge outlining basic ecological knowledge, such as carrying
                                        capacities, regarding estuarine ecosystems.

                                        Fabrizio Gianni and his fellow researchers set out to synthesize conservation strategies for <i>Cystoseira</i> forests, a type of macroalgae important to Mediterranean ecosystems. They state that the most important technique is reducing degradation factors; and point out that a good way to do this is with MPAs. The MPAs are a large focus of this piece as the researchers outline that <i>Cystoseira</i> forests within MPAs can act as propagules for natural restoration outside and inside the MPA and also act as prime real estate for anthropogenic restoration projects.

                                        Elisa Bayraktarov and her associates synthesize a wide variety of restoration studies in an attempt to assess the cost and success of restoration sites around the world. This literature review sources 235 studies from restoration projects involving coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass, as well as other species. They found important information such as the fact that restoration projects typically cost between $80,000-600,000 (2010). In addition, they determined that restoration projects in developing communities cost the least, while community- and volunteer-based projects were also relatively inexpensive. Lastly, restoration success depended largely on species, with coral and salt marshes performing best, while seagrasses performed the worst.

                                        Kenneth Moore and fellow associates assess how grazing practices and marine herbivory affect the restoration success of marine vegetation. More specifically, they see that the success of <i>Vallisneria americana</i> restoration depends on low grazing during the early periods of restoration (specifically seeding) as well as the restoration method (transplants, seeding dispersal, seed pod planting). In addition, they monitor the effects of different methods on sedimentation and water quality.

They attribute a higher success rate in Virginia, in part, to lower water temperatures and favorable policies that encourage restoration. While the largest hurdles in the two bay areas are low water quality combined with high water temperatures.

                                        Shafer Deborah and colleagues attempted here to assess the feasibility of using seeds as the primary source of restoration in Chesapeake Bay. They find that the speed of restoration is greatly increased, for example, 13.4 HA of area were restored 2003-2008, while only 3.8 HA of area were restored in the previous 21 years. While there could be many reasons for this, the difference is notable. This paper is best read in association with <u><i>“The role of habitat and herbivory on the restoration of tidal freshwater submerged aquatic vegetation populations”</i></u> as that paper is seemingly used as a resource in this paper.

                                        This document aims to outline conservation and restoration goals in Puget Sound, Washington. It sets out to determine what anthropogenic factors cause marine habitat decline and what species are most vulnerable to these declines. Additionally, it attempts to outline practices that best conserve and restore these habitats while recommending ways to improve awareness and management of declining habitats. Finally, they determine that successful protection and restoration require two prerequisites:

                                        This study by Susan Williams and her colleagues highlights the importance of biodiversity in restoration efforts. They find that, in the Coral Triangle, valuable fisheries, coastal protection, and many other ecosystem services provided by intact habitats are on the decline and thus restoration is needed. Furthermore, it is important that seagrass restoration sites had more success when more species were
                                        transplanted. It is a simple, but important finding.

                                        Carlos Duarte and his fellow researchers uncover an astonishing link between seagrass detritus and continental shelf/deep sea food webs. Moreover, by tracking the export of carbon outside of seagrass meadows, this paper highlights a forgotten portion of carbon sequestration provided by seagrasses. This finding helps further understand the importance of marine ecosystem services and provides support for the need of restoration projects and the scope of their impact.

                                        Frédéric Gazeau and his team attempt to profile the interplay between a photosynthetically dominated benthic environment and a planktonic, respiration dominated environment. In fact, they took samples of the surface water, as well as samples from within seagrass beds and measured their oxygen and carbon requirements over time. They found that benthic ecosystems dominated by Posidonia Oceanica meadows themselves were not enough to supply the carbon needs of the heterotrophic environments near the surface.

Additionally, the researchers outline a possible model for accounting for carbon flux within seagrass meadows, keeping in mind that the loss of such habitats would turn these imperative carbon sinks into carbon sources. Finally, they provide a list of research priorities that, if answered, would be likely to lead to policy change.

                                        Cymodocea nodosa meadows were analyzed by Fernando Tuya and his fellow researchers in an attempt to fully categorize the monetary value of seagrasses. They state that this has been a particularly difficult job in the past due to the multitude of ecosystem services and inherent interconnectivity of marine systems. Thus, they focus their efforts on the value of fish biomass that inhabits the ecosystem, proving fruitful with a value of 655,953.63 USD per hectare. They also go further in estimating the value of fish who migrate out of these meadows, using them as nurseries early in their life stages.

These researchers seek to determine the market value of raw kelp biomass, associated fisheries, climate change buffering, oxygen creation, value of non-commercial species, cultural value, and, interestingly enough, scientific value. In the end, they determined that kelp beds in Chile are estimated to be worth $540 million dollars.

                                        This publication by Lina Mtwana and her associates outlines the broad knowledge gaps within seagrass service research. By presenting ways to fill these gaps the article provides an in depth view of seagrass ecosystem services. This paper is based on the 2016 international workshop, <i>Seagrass ecosystem services – what's next?</i>, held in the UK which brought together a myriad of experts presenting at the International Seagrass Biology Workshop, the largest gathering dedicated to seagrass ecosystems.

That is, until this study found a stark difference between the variability in elevation of the benthic environment when comparing

As of April 2020, the full paper has not yet been published, but the abstract and preliminary findings paint a clear picture. The cultivation of kelp and shellfish in congruence can greatly improve both the overall health and shell thickness of mussels, while the kelp ecosystems provide a variable “halo effect” that can be quantitatively measured.

What they find is that the variability is more pronounced in the surface waters and is highly dependent on the time of day. Finally, this paper determines that kelp forests may have diel influence on pH and DO due to their large productive canopy. However, the paper has yet to be published in its entirety and the above
