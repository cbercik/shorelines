                    <div class="question py-2">Why is marine vegetation important?</div>
                    <p>Marine vegetation provides a number of valuable ecosystem services: preventing shoreline erosion, providing habitats and food for aquatic species such as fish, shellfish and invertebrates, and enhancing water quality. Restored seagrass meadows and kelp forests have encouraged the return of several species of aquatic organisms in different locations. Coastal shorelines are naturally defended from eroding waves thanks to seagrasses. Additionally, these aquatic plants help to filter both sediments and excess nutrients from surrounding water, which prevents the growth of deoxygenating algae. Supporting healthy habitats allows for biodiversity to thrive! The restoration of marine vegetation is a worthy investment.</p>

                    <div class="question py-2">How do these habitats impact our world?</div>
                    <p>On a broader scale, seagrass provides a possible mitigation strategy for the looming issue of climate change. When seagrass meadows are restored, they have proven extremely effective at quickly capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which can help to slow climate change and the greenhouse effect.</p>
				    <p>The blue carbon sequestered into seagrasses effectively converts dissolved carbon dioxide into floral biomass. This biomass provides the necessary organic compounds required for primary production, making seagrasses a food source for animals such as sea turtles, manatees, and migratory birds. The loss of this keystone species will damage the local ecosystem and affect the organisms that rely on seagrass meadows. Additionally, the destruction of seagrasses would have a significant economic impact, valued at a loss of US $19,002 per hectare per year.</p>

                    <div class="question py-2">What causes habitat destruction?</div>
                    <p>Over the last forty years, seagrass ecosystems have faced extreme losses. This is due to a multitude of reasons: pollution, urbanization, industry, physical disturbances, invasive species, and global climate change. The increase in coastal development and organic runoff has resulted in significant damages to seagrass habitats. Oftentimes a combination of anthropogenic and natural stressors result in the degradation of seagrass habitats.</p>
				    <p>For example, in Chesapeake Bay a combination of sedimentation and nutrient enrichment resulted in poorer water quality and therefore impacted the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation. Nutrient pollution is largely due to runoff, while sedimentation can be a result of different anthropogenic or natural factors, such as flooding.</p>

                    <div class="question py-2">Why is restoration necessary?</div>
                    <p>Natural recovery of seagrass ecosystems is slow, which is why the restoration of these habitats is necessary. Habitats created through restoration project efforts have been shown to both benefit wildlife as well as physical coastal environments. Restoration efforts such as the <a href="https://scc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/restore-shoreline/sfbay-living-shorline-project-052412.pdf" target="_blank">Living Shorelines project</a> - which combined eelgrass planting with oyster habitat restoration - were shown to increase both the biodiversity of aquatic organisms and decrease the energy from wave action. This resulted in less destruction and erosion of the coastal habitat, which in turn allowed the shoreline to rise along with the sea level. Rebuilding these marine habitats help to foster flourishing aquatic ecosystems which benefit our economies and environments alike.</p>
